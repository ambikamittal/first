First Github repository to learn

I am a front-end developer. I have more than 7 years of experience in front-end development. So far, I have used organization provided version control tools like SVN, TFS, Clear Quest. First time, trying to get my hands dirty on Github. It seems to be pretty cool. After this exercise, I will be adding my works to GitHub.

You rock GitHub!!!
